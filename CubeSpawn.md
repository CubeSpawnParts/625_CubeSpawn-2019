Introduction to the CubeSpawn ‘625’ Series

If you're reading this, you're exploring the CubeSpawn Open Source Manufacturing System.

“625”  denotes 600mm Cubes made from 25 mm Extrusion

Why “CubeSpawn?”

At the time of its conception it was “cubes making cubes” or cubes spawning cubes…and...It was a unique search term (with the popularity of MineCraft this is no longer true) and wrapped up the concept of a modular, recursive, cubical form factor based system in one word. 

Today, 6 years later, it is still relevant to what the process does and what it is.

This literature pertains to the 600mm (23.622 inches) model, this size was designed to be a balance between low cost and reasonable capabilities, the 600mm size was chosen for several ergonomic reasons and to conform to international (Metric) units while still interacting gracefully with the U.S’s feet and inches supply chain.

As benchtop sized machine, these models are in line with many of the open sourced 3D printers, laser cutters and tabletop routers that have come out in recent years.

While there are many open source machine designs in the world today and many more coming out regularly, very few of them are designed with automation in mind, that is to say: completely hands off operation and an ability to load and unload work into them automatically, This is what CubeSpawn main purpose is. We want to make completely automatic sets of machines that work together to create tools, products and projects from software templates, making it easier to build things anywhere.

This approach is much like industry, because our goal is to produce small batches of high-tech machines and devices from digital blueprints, and these blueprints must contain much more information that simply the shape and layout of a machine or device, it must also contain all the the details to prepare the raw materials AND make the objects needed AND how to assemble them and so on. 

This sounds complex (and in some ways it is) but this process is used daily in industry to make all the objects we buy and use, the real goal here is to put a version of industry into the hands of anyone who needs to make things while layering the technical requirements so that ANYONE can make the things they need, with a minimum of barriers.

All of this is open source so that anyone with specialized knowledge can improve the process for their own needs, and (if they choose to give back) their improvements can make the process easier for anyone else who chooses to use the system.



How Do I start?

There are 4 main ways to get started with a CubeSpawn system.
Tradeoffs between these methods are shown as a balance between Time, Money, Skills and Resources

Scratch Build/Bootstrap (Time ***** Skills ***** Money *)
This is potentially the lowest (monetary) cost, but you must have access to quite a large number of tools and some shop-space. this also requires the largest number of skills. It can take a few months, depending on how much time you can spend on this project. (link to bootstrappers document)

Kit Build/ Bootstrap (Time **** Skills *** Money **)
You may buy kits for basic machines and assemble them yourself, then use those machines to build the rest of your system  (link to cost/time estimate, required tools, and recommended start path)

All Kits (Time *** Skills ** Money ***)
Buy 1 kit for each desired machine, connect the machines together. (link to recommended kits document)

Buy Assembled. (Time * Skills * Money *****)
You may purchase Finished Modules from the CubeSpawn Store
Quick, requires only a few basic tools, Best solution for a quick start to a business application.
(link to startup from assembled document)

Keep in mind, even under best case times, this is NOT a weekend project, it takes time to build/assemble/setup/calibrate a system of machines, even when they are designed to work together. and the effort invested in ensuring everything is setup and working properly pays you back in less problems and higher quality production.


How does it work?

Each Cube contains a machine, built for a specific purpose, initially it will be one of the following 5 machines:
Lathe,
Milling Machine,
Surface Grinder
3D Printer
Pallet Mover
the first 4 machines all change materials shapes by cutting or depositing the material, the 5th machine transports the workpiece between the other 4

Unlike most of the small machines being built, these are not designed to be controlled directly by a human operator, but rather, are designed to be operated automatically by software
