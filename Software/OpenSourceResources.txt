There are several pieces of existing open source software that, when combined will form a comprehensive control system for machine tool and robotic hybrid systems

They are:
ROS (the Robot Operating System)

http://www.ros.org/

ROS Industrial (ROS for industry) from SwRI
http://rosindustrial.org/

ROS also provides a visualization and simulation environment.

MTConnect to provide a generic, industry standard interface between modules with differing capabilities and architectures.

Machinekit (CNC controller) to translate Gcode into motion on several different types of embedded ARM controller (R-Pi, BBB, others)

we are looking at STEPNC as a possible digital template - or at least a starting point for one - although it does a lot of other things as well.
