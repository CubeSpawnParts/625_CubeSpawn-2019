Each CubeSpawn machine consists of several subsystems:

CubeFrame - The enclosure that houses all the other pieces and connects to power and the network.
Backplane - the physical wiring between the Electrical/Electronics Module,(ElecModule) the Mechanical Module and the CubeFrame
ElecModule - where the onboard controller, power management and logic lives
MechModule - the Mechanical Module housing the sensors, motors, tools, end effectors and workpiece
Shell - a lightweight assembly frame to allow the machine to be "pre-assembled" to slide into the Mech Module


There are a few "Special Modules" planned for the system as well:

The Pallet Mover
This module is the heart of the automation since it brings pallets with attached workpieces to the machines, carries workpieces between machines.
This leads to a whole slew of accesory cubes that will support the general purpose machines:

Things like an auto fixture assembly cell, where the fixtures are configured for pallets in preperation of holding 
the stock to make parts on the MillCube (Milling Machine Cube)

A tool changer for the MillCube, which leads to a tool Setter to set tools with specific TLO (tool Length Offset) values and so on.

Once the core functions are established (MillCube, LatheCube, 3DPrintCube and Surface Grinder) then an expansion toward "nice to have" machine 
types will help grow the system toward its goals of recursion, bootstrapping, and completeness.
